		  <h3>The Problem</h3>
		  <br>
		  <p class="font-weight-light">
		  	Students’ desire for a tertiary education usually leaves little to no foreseeable time for off-campus interaction and exploration. An opportunity to get students engaged in the outdoors or simply pay attention to their environment while socially competiting or interacting was discovered. However, the question remained, how might these students regain a substantial social life that complements their learning? 
		  </p>
		  </div>

		  <!--SECTION 2-->
		  
		  <div> 
		  
		  <h3>Assumptions</h3>
		  <br>
		  <p class="font-weight-light">
		 	 It was understood that this project would have to exist on a platform that was preferred by students such as mobile and undoubtedly allow for social concepts as experienced from mobile gaming apps. Also, I assumed that choosing the city of London to deploy the project, in order to help students learn more about the city and widen their social circle would be a great start.  
		  </p>
		  </div>

		  <br>
		
		  <!--SECTION 3-->
		  
		  <div> 
		  
		  <h3>Plan</h3>
		  <br>
		  <p class="font-weight-light">
		  	The plan involved user research &#40;observing and surveying a sample set&#41; of students at the University of Westminster in order to test the assumptions. When the base assumptions were proven more market research was conducted to conclude other assumptions which arose during the initial research. This step would influence the actual product's design and development process. The development process followed a lean software development model focusing on eliminating waste and deleviering quickly. This model was fitting in order to deliver a project within a short deadline. Later we'll uncover how this decision affected the project. Moreover, the final stage involved usability testing to ensure the product met the requirements derived from the insights collected during the user and market research. <br>
		  </p>

		  <!--SECTION 4-->
		  
		  <div> 
		  
		  <h3>Market Research</h3>
		  <br>
		  <p class="font-weight-light">
		  I was curious about what existed in the market relevant to a project of this particular nature, and the approach developers and designers took to make their products successful. I found that these developers generously seek funding for their projects, “both in terms of localising their content and investing in western companies- to take their success global” (Jon Jordan, 2016). The major developers barely changed this strategy, year after year. They’ve also stuck to generic monetisation strategies such as paid downloads and in-app purchases while forsaking in-app advertising or out-of-app subscriptions (AppAnnie, 2016). On the other hand, designers were more concerned with the interface design and user's experience; was the design appealing to the types of players and did it foster a state of flow?  
		  </p>
			  
		   <p class="font-weight-light">
			 Further research determined that this adventure game should seek the attention of the following player types as recognised by Bartle’s Taxonomy within the age groups of 18 to 24; 
			 <ul class="font-weight-light" style="list-style: square"> 
			   <li>Explorers. The games adventure genre will target these players.</li>
			   <li>Socialisers. This dual player game will allow for the establishment of relationships and in future include direct interaction with more players.</li>
			   <li>Achievers. This player type will be able to challenge the time sensitivity of this game and impress themselves and their opponent on their swiftness.</li>
			 </ul>
			 </p>
			 <br>
		  	 <p class="font-weight-light">
			 These players tend to be University students or persons who have just entered the labour force. Their responsibilities and commitments are less compared to adults in the other age groups. Thus, they will have the means (time and money) to play this inexpensive game.
			 <br>  
			 Players will also be persons who are early adopters and are always on the lookout for something new.

		  <h3>Wireframes</h3>
		  <br>
		  <p class="font-weight-light">
		  At this stage, I created a low-fidelity wireframe to map the application's foundation of interactions and layout. Wireframes were an effective way of simply showing the layout vision before considering aesthetics and gaining primary feedback. These wireframes went through several iterative rounds neglecting the use of images, animations, and including basic typography.

		  The first view (left to right) featured the game pre-play view layout: hitting the CTA 'Start Game' button, users were able to start the game; this button connected them to the multi-player setup view which allows another user to play along. The Leaderboard and Options button provides connections to user game data and settings for better game experiences. The top part of the screen showed the game's name and version, while the bottom part of the screen displayed an exit button then an advertisement space.
		<br><br>	
		  The second view featured the process of opponent selection: the row of icons/symbols allows users to choose an X or O Sprite which represents them. Also, users could select the color for the Sprite and hitting the button, confirms selection for the game.
		<br><br>
		  The third view showed the actual layout of the gameplay. The full name of the game is Going Places free, so users may not only have fun playing Noughts &amp; Crosses but within limited time go to actual places listed on the game board. The bottom of the view gives users the option of exiting the game or upgrading to the premium version.
		<br><br>
		  When all the interactions were agreed upon and tested, the project advanced to the UI design stage. At this stage, the ultimate goal was to allow the interaction flow to get a nice and fun yet mature appearance and emotional appeal.

		  <h3>Initital UI Designs</h3>
		  <br>
		  <p class="font-weight-light">
		  The UI solution for this mobile game app began with identifying a colour scheme which corresponded with the vision of the game style. The palette used a combination of cold colors, mostly based on blue with a hint of gold, belonging to the most popular colours among the targeted player types. The game design assets such as the sprites were also designed from scratch for the game to give it a unique look.

		  <h3>Mood Test</h3>
		  <br>
		  <p class="font-weight-light">
		  I am a firm believer in continually testing designs throughout the creation process. Here I wanted to make sure I was on the right track before completing the high-fidelity mockups. The idea was to create mock-ups of the application's main views then test them with recruited users using usabilityhub.com. I was able to then create a mood test that showed participants my design and asked them: “How do these screens make you feel? Please list the first adjective or emotion which comes to mind." The majority of the responses captured the desired mood or description perfectly.

		  <h3>Takeaway</h3>
		  <br>
		  <p class="font-weight-light">
			By working on this project, I realised how much I enjoy the learning and design process of creating socially interactive games. I appreciate C# as much as the next coder however, I flourish in areas of concept and interface design way more. It's all fun and games playing the latest multiplayer online game but, when you're tasked with creating your own concept and bringing it to fruition, that opens up the floodgates of possibilities. Before this journey, my knowledge of game design and C# was equivalent to a teaspoon. And, although this was a school-based project and my knowledge hasn't exceeded a large commercial cooking pot yet, I am determined to move this project from the classroom to the real world. 
			<br>  
		  	I learnt these lessons while submitting this project;
			  <ol class="font-weight-light">
			  	<li>
				  The development of certain components of the application was tricky due to being a Unity 3D novice. In an effort to challenge myself and overcome a learning curve, I would have reduced the capabilities of the application until I was comfortable enough with the game engine.
				</li>
				<li>
				  Allow for more in-depth user testing in various environments to observe their behaviour under certain stressers to ensure a state of flow is maintained. 
				</li>
